make everything run through a game element
  use a constructor that takes the clicked element as an argument
  properties:
  property to keep track of status / who's turn
  array for user moves
  method to loop thru array and see if consecutive moves happened
  object that holds elements
  event listener
    if user1 clicks an element, status = 1
      then 'x' is the input to a cell
      put an 'x' into the moves array
    if user0 clicks an element, status = 0
      then o is the input to a cell
      put an 'o' into the moves array
    use loop method to check for consecutive moves
      if there are consecutive moves, display the winner with consecutive moves


on click, the user inputs an x or o into a cell.
  //each cell has an event listener that fires off on click
then the computer, or another user clicks the other letter into another cell.
  keep track of what letter gets entered with a status variable
  if user1 clicks an element, status = 1
    then x is the input to a cell
  if user0 clicks an element, status = 0
    then o is the input to a cell
if one user puts three x's or o's in a row, he wins. game over.
  keep track of user inputs with an array.
    on click, loop thru the array
      if there are three letters in a row, signal that there is a winner
